  <!-- This is how you make a comment in HTML <3-->
  <!-- some important HTML tags are   main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section-->
  <!-- You can add images to your website by using the **img** element, and point to a specific image's URL using the **src** attribute.-->

  <!-- Here's an example UwU:-->
  <img
    src="https://images.app.goo.gl/stQcnZZRLjU1zBU1A"
    alt="This is hanako-kun, my baby."
  />
  <!-- For images you should have an alt in case the picture won't load. This is demonstrated below-->

  <img
    src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"
    alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
  />

  <!-- here i use an anchor **a** which will link to a destination web address.This needs an href attribute-->

  <a href="https://github.com/"
    >This is an inappropriate link to an innapropriate website</a
  >
  <!-- So this is basically a hyperlink that will say the message that follows the destination link.-->
  <!--(anchor) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.-->

  <!--You can also have nested things within text. Its really similar to concatenation, and all you have to do is
have the same thing you would have outside the text within the text. Here's an example:-->
  <p>
    View more cat photos, where
    <a href="https://freecatphotoapp.com" target="_blank">cat photos</a>.
  </p>

  <!--Here's also something you should take note of. When an anchor doesn't have a target it will open the whatever 
you anchor within the same window. But if you have a _blank target, then when the user clicks on the anchor it will
show them whatever was anchored in a new window. Whether it be an external or internal anchor.-->
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>

  <!--Here's also something very important you want to pay attention to. When you know what you want to anchor, but
but you don't have the href value yet, you can just make the href equal "#",and it will be a dead link that doesn't do anything-->
  <a href="#"
    ><img
      src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"
      alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."
  /></a>
  <p> Here I nest an image link in a dead link anchor.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Babies</li>
    <li>They love food and will kill you if they don't get it</li>
    <li>Cats love making messes</li>
  </ul>
<p>HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point style lists
Unordered lists start with an opening <ul> element, followed by
any number of <li> elements. Finally, unordered lists close with a </ul> </p>

  <ol>
    <li>People</li>
    <li>Human interactions</li>
    <li>Hate when they don't get sleep</li>
  </ol>
  <p>HTML has another special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered lists.
Ordered lists start with an opening <ol> element, followed by any number of <li>
elements. Finally, ordered lists are closed with the </ol> tag.</p>
  <p>
    The difference between ul and ol are is ul are bulleted or dotted lists
    whereas ol is numbered list
  </p>

  <input type="text" />
  <p>
    Now let's create a web form. input elements are a convenient way to get
    input from your user. You can create a text input by using format
    <!--<input type="text" />-->
  </p>

  <input type="text" placeholder="Your mom likes dilfs" />
  <p>
    Now lets get a little bit more advanced by adding a placeholder text What
    this does is have a text in the input before the user types anything. Once
    the user types anything The textbox it is replaced with the users input
  </p>
  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Cat Photo URL" />
  </form>
  <p>
    You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing
    more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action attribute on
    your form element.
  </p>

  <button type="submit">This button will submit your form, love.</button>
  <p>
    Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the
    data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action
    attribute.
  </p>

  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" placeholder="Sexy DILFS" />
    <button type="submit">Submit Button you Dumbass<3</button>
  </form>
  <p>
    can also add a submit button within a form.... this will submit the
    information you typed in the form upon the user click>
  </p>

  <form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <input type="text" required placeholder="cat photo URL" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  <p>
    You can add a requirement of text fill for your inputs, so that they can't
    submit anything without having an input This can be useful for stuff like
    when a user is entering important information like a DOB or payment
    information. That is required in order for them to submit and move on to
    something else within your website.
  </p>

  <form>
    <label for="indoor">
      <input id="indoor"type="radio"name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor
    </label>
    <label for="outdoor">
      <input id="outdoor"type="radio"name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor
    </label>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  <p>You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
    Radio buttons are a type of input.
    Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label
    element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
    All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, 
    selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one
    answer is provided by the user.
    It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of the
    id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between the label
    and the child input element.
